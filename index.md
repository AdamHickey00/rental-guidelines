## **Application Process**

Each person over the age of 18 who will be living in the home must complete and submit a separate application and processing fee. In order to qualify, each person must meet or exceed the minimum standards for qualification. Incomplete applications will not be processed. Applications containing false information will immediately be disqualified. Please expect 1-3 days for the application process. Processing the Application will include direct contact with employers, current landlord, previous landlords, friends, personal and professional references, law enforcement agencies, government agencies, consumer reporting agencies, public records, eviction records, and any other sources that may be deemed necessary. A consumer report will be used in the processing of all applications. Should the Applicant be denied or face other adverse action based on information received in the consumer report, the Applicant has a right to obtain a free copy of the consumer report, and to dispute the accuracy of the information it contains by contacting the consumer reporting agency directly.

## **Deposit to Hold**

After approval, if tenant will not be taking occupancy within 24 hours, a non-refundable Deposit to Hold in the amount equal to one month’s rent will be required within 24 hours to hold the property until a mutually agreed upon move-in date. The maximum amount of time a rental will be held is 14 days. After all move-in requirements have been met and a lease for the property completed, the Deposit to Hold will transfer to the security deposit to be held throughout the tenant’s entire tenancy. If the Prospective Tenant fails to provide the Deposit to Hold within 24 hours of approval, the home will be offered to the next qualified applicant. Should the Applicant elect to pay the Deposit to Hold with their application (prior to processing), the Deposit to Hold will be refunded in full within 14 days if they fail to qualify.

## **Move-in Requirements**

After approval and before occupancy will be granted, you must: 

- Supply all the required move-in funds, including the security deposit, first month’s rent, and any other additional deposits and fees,
- Switch over all tenant paid utilities into your name,
- Provide proof of renter's insurance of at least $100,000, and
- Execute a lease that will be signed by all parties.
